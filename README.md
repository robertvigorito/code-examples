# Code Descriptions
> Production example of previous developed tools, descriptions below:

### Store n Change
This was a quick tool I made for my previous lead that is currently working on a disney animated production. Which allowed artists to 
store node setting within a json file that they can share amongst the production. Great for custom gizmos that have different day or 
night looks.

### Edl Seperator
Clients were delivery edl files with shot data in the same file, this is a tool that separates the edl per shot. Create using pyside. 

### Global Copy and Paste
Gives the artist the ability to quickly share nodes over the server, by defining a server location to save the artist copy and paste information, 
artists are able to select from a list of who they would like to copy from. The tool has preset setup for the option of quick paste, 
where we grab the last artist you copied from

### Mr Wolf Launcher
Is a base tool that automatically appends all custom studio tools to a nice ui to help organize workflow and prevent having numerous shortcut icon
on the desktop.

### Shotgun Shot Creator
Allows the producer to create numerous shots into shotgun, features include:
- Create shots with listed details.
- Create project server work folder structure
- Creates base nuke and flame working files with correct show spec and import ref and work plates
- Uploading reference plates to shotgun
